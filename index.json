attacks pose a critical security threat to natural language processing (NLP) models by establishing covert associations between trigger patterns and target labels without affecting normal accuracy. Existing attacks usually disregard fluency and semantic fidelity of poisoned text, rendering the malicious data easily detectable. However, text generation models can produce coherent and content-relevant text given prompts. Moreover, potential differences between human-written and AI-generated text may be captured by NLP models while being imperceptible to humans. More insidious threats could arise if attackers leverage latent features of AI-generated text as trigger patterns. We comprehensively investigate backdoor attacks on NLP models using AI-generated poisoned text obtained via continued writing or paraphrasing, exploring three attack scenarios: data, model and pre-training. For data poisoning, we fine-tune generators with attribute control to enhance the attack performance. For model poisoning, we leverage downstream tasks to derive specialized generators. For pre-training poisoning, we train multiple attribute-based generators and align their generated text with pre-defined vectors, enabling task-agnostic migration attacks. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves effective attacks while maintaining fluency and semantic similarity across all scenarios.

Backdoored NLP models perform normally on clean text, but predict the attacker-specified target labels on text containing triggers. Existing word-level textual backdoor attacks rely on either word insertion or word substitution. Word-insertion backdoor attacks can be easily detected by simple backdoor defenses. Meanwhile, wordsubstitution backdoor attacks tend to substantially degrade the fluency and semantic consistency of the poisoned text. In this paper, we propose a more natural word substitution method to implement covert textual backdoor attacks. Specifically, we combine three different ways to construct a diverse synonym thesaurus for clean text. We then train a learnable word selector for producing poisoned text using a composite loss function of poison and fidelity terms. This enables automated selection of minimal critical word substitutions necessary to induce the backdoor. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves high attack performance with less impact on fluency and semantics.

This paper proposes a novel deep neural network based method for fine-grained lip image segmentation that exploits fuzzy and graph theories to handle these variations. A fuzzy learning module is designed to deal with the uncertainties in color and edge information and enhance feature maps at various scales. The fuzzy graph reasoning module with fuzzy projection models the relationship among semantics components and achieves a global receptive field.

We propose \"FedPrompt\" studying prompt tuning in a model split aggregation way using FL, and prove that split aggregation greatly reduces the communication cost, only 0.01% of the PLMs’ parameters, with little decrease on accuracy both on IID and Non-IID data distribution. We further conduct backdoor attacks by data poisoning on FedPrompt. Experiments show that attack achieve a quite low attack success rate and can not inject backdoor effectively, proving the robustness of FedPrompt.","tags":null,"title":"FedPrompt: Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Prompt Tuning in Federated Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["郭子豪","王士林"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1683244800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1683244800,"objectID":"9f20db5c7b7e3bca320d992464e09cd9","permalink":"https://sjtuaiseclab.github.io/publication/conference/2023-icassp-guozihao-content-insensitive-dynamic-lip/","publishdate":"2023-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference/2023-icassp-guozihao-content-insensitive-dynamic-lip/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent research has shown that lip-based speaker authenti- cation system can achieve good authentication performance.

Although existing DeepFake detection methods achieve remarkable progress in some specific scenarios, their detection performance usually drops drastically when detecting unseen manipulation methods. Compared with static information such as human face, dynamic information depicting the movements of facial features is more difficult to forge without leaving visual or statistical traces. Hence, in order to achieve better generalization ability, we focus on dynamic information analysis to disclose such traces and propose a novel Complementary Dynamic Interaction Network (CDIN). Inspired by the DeepFake detection methods based on mouth region analysis, both the global (entire face) and local (mouth region) dynamics are analyzed with properly designed network branches, respectively, and their feature maps at various levels are communicated with each other using a newly proposed Complementary Cross Dynamics Fusion Module (CCDFM). With CCDFM, the global branch will pay more attention to anomalous mouth movements and the local branch will gain more information about the global context. Finally, a multi-task learning scheme is designed to optimize the network with both the global and local information.

Many detectors cannot achieve accurate results when detecting unseen manipulations despite excellent performance on known forgeries. In this paper, we are motivated by the observation that the discrepancies between real and fake videos are extremely subtle and localized, and inconsistencies or irregularities can exist in some critical facial regions across various information domains. To this end, we propose a novel pipeline, Cross-Domain Local Forensics (XDLF), for more general deepfake video detection. In the proposed pipeline, a specialized framework is presented to simultaneously exploit local forgery patterns from space, frequency, and time domains, thus learning cross-domain features to detect forgeries. Moreover, the framework leverages four high-level forgery-sensitive local regions of a human face to guide the model to enhance subtle artifacts and localize potential anomalies. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the impressive performance of our method, and we achieve superiority over several state-of-the-art methods on cross-dataset generalization. We also examined the factors that contribute to its performance through ablations, which suggests that exploiting cross-domain local characteristics is a noteworthy direction for developing more general deepfake detectors.","tags":null,"title":"Cross-Domain Local Characteristic Enhanced Deepfake Video Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["程彭洲","刘功申"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1668038400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1668038400,"objectID":"527575e9d84c15a76d4df1601981d0b0","permalink":"https://sjtuaiseclab.github.io/publication/journal/2022-fgcs-chengpengzhou-towards-an-efficient-real/","publishdate":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal/2022-fgcs-chengpengzhou-towards-an-efficient-real/","section":"publication","summary":"Controller area network (CAN) is a widely used communication protocol for in-vehicle networks. With the up-gradation of traditional vehicle ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to the internet of vehicles (IoV), the connectivity is incremental between the vehicular network and the outside world, making cyber-security become a stringent problem. Although existing machine learning-based methods for automotive intrusion detection are powerful, there are still limitations in detection performance and resistance attack types during the unsupervised learning process that lacks massive amounts of labels. Therefore, this paper proposes an in-vehicle intrusion detection system that incorporates a combination of sparse regularization convolutional auto-encoder (SRCAE) and streams clustering to construct a deep evolving stream clustering model, namely DESC-IDS. Specifically, the method encodes continuous messages as 2-D data frames, which are fed into the SRCAE built by the temporal convolutional network (TCN) to obtain a low-dimensional non-linear spatial–temporal mapping of the high-dimensional data. Thereafter, the stream clustering model can describe a contour baseline of normal communication messages by the spatial–temporal features. Based on this baseline, DESC-IDS can detect any abnormal changes in vehicular communication. In particular, this paper exploits the SRCAE to reconstruct message matrices, which are considered as variants of known attacks due to reconstruction deviation. The extensive evaluation results illustrate that the proposed model provides enough performance and real-time competitiveness in anomaly detection, with 96.44% accuracy on the HCRL intrusion dataset and 98.80% accuracy on the ORNL intrusion dataset. For the mixed attack of fabrication and masquerade, the proposed model achieves stable F1-scores of 93.48% and 86.99%, respectively. Moreover, the performance in unknown attacks is righteous with 98.43% accuracy and 97.15% F1-scores.","tags":null,"title":"DESC-IDS: Towards an Efficient Real-time Automotive Intrusion Detection System Based on Deep Evolving Stream Clustering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["赵皓东","杜巍","郭俊杰","刘功申"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1663459200,"objectID":"295cf18723eb10a2a977ed864e5ab1d1","permalink":"https://sjtuaiseclab.github.io/publication/conference/2022-interspeech-zhaohaodong-a-universial-identity-backdoor/","publishdate":"2022-09-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference/2022-interspeech-zhaohaodong-a-universial-identity-backdoor/","section":"publication","summary":"Speaker verification has been widely used in many authentication scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack for the above scenario. Specifically, for the Siamese network in the speaker verification system, we try to implant a universal identity in the model that can simulate any enrolled speaker and pass the verification. So the attacker does not need to know the victim, which makes the attack more flexible and stealthy. In addition, we design and compare three ways of selecting attacker utterances and two ways of poisoned training for the GE2E loss function in different scenarios. The results on the TIMIT and Voxceleb1 datasets show that our approach can achieve a high attack success rate while guaranteeing the normal verification accuracy.

In this paper, we propose Sense-aware BERT (SenBERT) which allows sense information integrated with BERT during fine-tuning. In particular, we exploit multimodal multi-head attention to capture the interaction between unaligned multimodal data. Additionally, due to the variable information richness of different modalities, multimodal network may be dominated by some modalities during training process, so we propose unimodal sentiment analysis auxiliary tasks for multi-task learning which forces the model to focus on all modalities.

Faced with the two challenges, we propose an incrementally few-shot instance selection approach (TIMS) based on model similarity and outlier detection, which suits the starting step of active learning well and serves as a better benchmark for few-shot learning. Specifically, TIMS determines the representative candidate set by calculating the similarity between changes in model parameters caused by each instance and by the full dataset. Meanwhile, Isolation Forest is adopted to select instances from the candidate set for annotation, which prevents selected instances from being too similar. Comprehensive experiments on WikiLingua \u0026 SQuAD show that TIMS outperforms other algorithms across almost every circumstance.
